# Algorithms-Lab
Project Work for MSc Algorithms Lab course offered at ETH Zurich (263-0006-00L).

This code is not nicely written and was done under time constraint during the semester to solve the exercises. But I figured that it might still be helpful to some students.

Most of the solutions are my own, while some of them were inspired by either community solutions or example solutions.
